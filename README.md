# ead-web: The personal website of Ethan A. David
This is the (public open-source version of) my personal website. It is implemented as a Firebase Web App, and almost entirely built on Angular 5. It is worth noting that it is NOT possible to run this project locally -- the Firebase configuration is unavailable in this repository for security reasons. If I find a good solution for this, I'll update this repository. If you would like to see this page live, visit [https://ethanadavid.com](ethanadavid.com).
